## Requirements 

	‚Ä¢	The score on the top left of the screen should increase of one point for each alien destroyed.
	‚Ä¢	A health point should be removed for each alien passing the ship‚Äôs ‚Äúhorizon‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	A health point should be removed for each collision of an alien with the ship
	‚Ä¢	When the health points reach the count of zero, the game should stop and display a game over screen with the score. Users should be able to decide whether quit the game or retry.
	‚Ä¢	(plus) The current game difficulty is represented by the velocity and frequency of alien spawn. You may implement a way to handle such difficulty. Starting from an easy setup, shifting toward a more challenging game.
	‚Ä¢	Store in an arbitrary file information regarding user inputs and score. Other information such as the total played sessions and total played time should be stored.
	‚Ä¢	(plus) Upload such data in a local database or remote database or remote system (azure, amazon S3, ‚Ä¶)
